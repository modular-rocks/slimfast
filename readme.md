# Slimfast base - putting your code on a diet with automatic modularisation

## Before you install

This is the base, designed for framework specific versions to extend from. The first of these framework specific versions will be [slimfast-node](https://github.com/modular-rocks/slimfast-node).

## Installation

`npm install @modular-rocks/slimfast`

or 

`yarn add @modular-rocks/slimfast` 

## Usage

Slimfast is a workspace designed to take a codebase and create a refactored version of it. Read more about [Workspaces here](https://github.com/modular-rocks/workspace).

To use Slimfast, use one of the framework specific versions below:

[Slimfast-node](https://github.com/modular-rocks/slimfast-node)

[Slimfast](https://github.com/modular-rocks/slimfast/blob/main/src/index.ts) simply creates two versions of the same codebase and modularises one. This is the base for building environment/language specific versions, read more about [slimfast-node here](https://github.com/modular-rocks/slimfast-node).
